NOTE: You might get a dialog saying there is a Missing Project ID so you can't use Unity Services.  Select "Yes" and continue.

Under the Assets folder in project pane, open the 'MainScene' in _Scenes folder.
From Unity, choose File->Build Settings to bring up the Build Settings window. 
Click Add open scenes to in build section, it should be checked. 

### Choose Universal Windows Platform as the Platform.

+ XAML as the UWP Build Type

+ Latest Installed as the SDK

+ Check "Unity C# Projects"

+ Then click Build. 

+ Select the folder called 'UWP' and choose this folder.

### Open the UnityXAML\UWP\UnityXAML.sln in MSVC 2017 or higher.
  Select Debug|Release and x64|x32|Any CPU (depending on your VS configuration)
* Visual Studio 2017 is required to build this project

Once you have opened the solution you can Build->Solution and then run the sample.  

NOTE: If you get an option "Attach to unity" you have opened the incorrect SLN file.  Ensure you open the UnityXAML\UWP\UnityXAML.sln and not UnityXaml\UnityXAML.sln

The sample is composed of two parts, the XAML portion and the unity portion with a communication class used to pass information between them.

When you start the application you should get a split screen view.

#### The upper portion is controlled by the mainpage.xaml and contain:
* Two buttons
* A text block
* And a web view
#### The lower is the unity scene, which contains:
* One button 
* And a view used to show results.

Pressing "Web Navigate XAML" cause the XAML web view to navigate to a web page.
Pressing "Send To Unity (XAML)" will cause the feedback view to show a new message.
Pressing "SendDataToXAML (UB)" will cause a message to be sent to the xaml portion showing a count of events from Unity.
